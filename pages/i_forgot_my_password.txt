====== Forgotten Password ======

:?: I forgot my password. What can I do?

:!: If the admin didn't disable any necessary functions, you can go to the login page and click on "Send new password" (see [How to login](https://www.dokuwiki.org/login#how_to_login) for more information). If this doesn't work, ask the admin to give you a new password in the [UserManager](https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:usermanager).

:?: But sending a new password doesn't work and I **am the admin** and cannot access the User Manager. How can I retrieve my password and get back my admin permissions?

:!: You can
  - register a new user
  - open ''conf/local.php''
    * change the superuser to your newly registered user <code>$conf['superuser'] = 'foo';</code>
    * **or** if the superuser is a group like <code>$conf['superuser'] = '@admin';</code> just remember its name
      - open ''conf/users.auth.php''
      - search the line that begins with the name of your newly registered user (it should be the last line)
      - and add the name of the superuser group to the very end of that line, like <code>...:user,admin</code>
  - then you can login as the new user
  - change the password of your old user
  - logout
  - login again as the old user
  - and delete the new one again (not necessary, but advisable if you're concerned about security)
